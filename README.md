This is a very basic game using Javascript. 
The purpose of the game is that you guess a number and then you execute the code and you will receieve from the computer if you have guessed the correct number that you thought of.
There are two Js.files, and they only differ in their operators (if-else or ternary) but the outcome is the same.
